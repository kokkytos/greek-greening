# Greening and green-space inequality trends in Greek urban areas

This repository is supplementary to the manuscript of "Greening and green-space inequality trends in Greek urban areas".

This is the code for the preproccessing of Landsat-5 (2000-2011) and Landsat-8 (2014-2020), Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1 datasets. 

It also generates the NDVI, NDWI, and the spectral unmixing model for the greek Large Urban Zones (LUZ) based on sampled values of the three end members (vegetation, water and barren/urban).

## Usage

The code is available in a [Jupyter Notebook](Code.ipynb).
